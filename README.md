# graphing-calculator
A simple graphing calculator made in Python with Numpy and Matplotlib

For now, this is just a command line program (except for the graph window) but eventually I do make a seperate version with a GUI, and add more features to make it a genuine full-fledged graphing calculator.

to-do list (not in any particular order):
- add GUI
- add more calc features (dy/dx, minima/maxima, etc.)
- add more operators (|x|, logarithms, factorials etc.)
- write some official documentation
- and probably more!
