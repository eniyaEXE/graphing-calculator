# graphing-calculator
A simple graphing calculator made in Python with Numpy and Matplotlib

For now, this is just another command line program (except for the graph window) but eventually I do want to add GUI to this, and add more features to make it a genuine full-fledged graphing calculator.

ROADMAP (not in any particular order):
- add GUI
- add calc features (dy/dx, minima/maxima, etc.)
- add more operators (|x|, logarithms, factorials etc.)
- add constants (pi, e, tau etc.)
- add settings and customization
- add possibility for multiple equations at the same time
- and probably more!
